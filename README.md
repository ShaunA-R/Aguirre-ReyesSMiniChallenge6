Thank you for giving me a peer review :)
Peer Review: Jeremy Lapham. Good program pretty nice simple code. But you have no data validation. If I were to enter a letter or word instead of a number then it breaks the program completely. Also at the end when it asks if I want to play again and I type something like "sure" it'll still end.
